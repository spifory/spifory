Hi there! I'm Sham/toolifelesstocode! I am a backend software developer who is mostly interested in making bots for chat platforms such as Discord and Eludris. I usually mess around with Python and TypeScript, and I am currently learning Golang.

I am currently working on some projects at [PrimerNetwork](https://github.com/PrimerNetwork).
